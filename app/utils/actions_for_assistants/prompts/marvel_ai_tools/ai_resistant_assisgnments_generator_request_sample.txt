YOU MUST RESPECT THE VARIABLE NAMES

The input can be **either** an "assignment_description" if the assignment details are provided as text, **or** a combination of "file_url" and "file_type" if the input is a file. For example:

- **If the input is text**: Provide the assignment description in the "assignment_description" field and leave "file_url" and "file_type" blank.
- **If the input is a file**: Provide the file's URL in the "file_url" field, specify the file type (e.g., "pdf") in the "file_type" field, and leave "assignment_description" blank.

### Example: Input is a File  
tool_data:  
tool_id: ai-resistant-assignments-generator  
assignment_description:  
grade_level: university  
file_url: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/kai-ai-f63c8.appspot.com/o/uploads%2F510f946e-823f-42d7-b95d-d16925293946-Linear%20Regression%20Stat%20Yale.pdf?alt=media&token=caea86aa-c06b-4cde-9fd0-42962eb72ddd  
file_type: pdf  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the assignment is provided as a file. The "assignment_description" field is left empty, and both the "file_url" and "file_type" fields are populated.

### Example: Input is Text  
tool_data:  
tool_id: ai-resistant-assignments-generator  
assignment_description: Write a detailed report on the applications of linear regression in statistics.  
grade_level: university  
file_url:  
file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the assignment is provided as a text description. The "file_url" and "file_type" fields are left blank.

### Key Rules:  
1. Use **only one type of input** at a time: either "assignment_description" or "file_url" with "file_type."  
2. Ensure the "lang" and "grade_level" fields are always filled, regardless of input type.
