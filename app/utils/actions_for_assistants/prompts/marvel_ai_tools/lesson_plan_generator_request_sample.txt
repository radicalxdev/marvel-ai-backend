YOU MUST RESPECT THE VARIABLE NAMES

### Input Guidelines:

1. **Grade Level** (`grade_level`):  
   - Specifies the educational level of the lesson (e.g., `university`, `high`, `middle`).  

2. **Topic** (`topic`):  
   - Defines the subject or focus of the lesson (e.g., "Linear Algebra").  

3. **Objectives** (`objectives`):  
   - Can be provided as text or as a file using `objectives_file_url` and `objectives_file_type`. Use one input type at a time.  

4. **Additional Customization** (`additional_customization`):  
   - Optional. Can be provided as text or as a file using `additional_customization_file_url` and `additional_customization_file_type`. Use one input type at a time or leave both blank if no customization is needed.  

5. **File URLs and Types**:  
   - `objectives_file_url` and `objectives_file_type` provide objectives as a file, where the type specifies the file format (e.g., `pdf`, `docx`).  
   - `additional_customization_file_url` and `additional_customization_file_type` provide additional customization as a file, where the type specifies the file format (e.g., `gdoc`, `docx`).  

6. **Language** (`lang`):  
   - Defines the language of the lesson (default is `en`).

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Objectives and Additional Customization as Files  
tool_data:  
tool_id: lesson-generator  
grade_level: university  
topic: Linear Algebra  
objectives:  
additional_customization:  
objectives_file_url: https://example.com/objectives.pdf  
objectives_file_type: pdf  
additional_customization_file_url: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkOTKlHnZC6Us2N-ZHgECsQezYoB49af/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107052763106493355624&rtpof=true&sd=true
additional_customization_file_type: gdoc  
lang: en  

- **Here**, both objectives and additional customization are provided as files, so their respective text fields are left blank.

---

#### Example 2: Objectives as Text, No Additional Customization  
tool_data:  
tool_id: lesson-generator  
grade_level: university  
topic: Linear Algebra  
objectives: Students should understand the basics of matrix operations and their applications in real-world problems.  
additional_customization:  
objectives_file_url:  
objectives_file_type:  
additional_customization_file_url:  
additional_customization_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, objectives are provided as text, and no additional customization is included (both text and file fields for customization are left blank).

---

#### Example 3: Mixed Input (Objectives as File, Additional Customization as Text)  
tool_data:  
tool_id: lesson-generator  
grade_level: university  
topic: Linear Algebra  
objectives:  
additional_customization: Include examples of applications in computer graphics and machine learning.  
objectives_file_url: https://example.com/objectives.pdf  
objectives_file_type: pdf  
additional_customization_file_url:  
additional_customization_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, objectives are provided as a file, while additional customization is provided as text.

---

### Key Rules:

1. **Objectives**:  
   - Use **either** `objectives` (text) or `objectives_file_url` and `objectives_file_type` (file), but not both.  

2. **Additional Customization**:  
   - Optional. Use **either** `additional_customization` (text) or `additional_customization_file_url` and `additional_customization_file_type` (file), but not both. Leave both fields empty if no customization is required.  

3. **Mix-and-Match**:  
   - You can mix text and file inputs for objectives and additional customization, depending on availability.  

4. **File Types**:  
   - Ensure correct file types (e.g., `pdf`, `gdoc`, `docx`) are specified for file inputs.  

5. **Language**:  
   - Default language is `en`. Specify if a different language is required.
