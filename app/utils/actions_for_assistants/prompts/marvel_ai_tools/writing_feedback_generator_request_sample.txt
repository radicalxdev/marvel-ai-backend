1. **Grade Level** (`grade_level`):  
   - Specifies the educational level (e.g., `university`, `high`, `middle`).  

2. **Assignment Description** (`assignment_description`):  
   - A brief description of the assignment or context for the writing to be reviewed (e.g., "Linear Algebra").  

3. **Criteria** (`criteria`):  
   - Specifies the evaluation criteria for the feedback. Can be provided as text in `criteria` or as a file using `criteria_file_url` and `criteria_file_type`. Use one input type at a time.

   - The text of the writing to be reviewed. Can be provided as a string in `writing_to_review` or as a file using `writing_to_review_file_url` and `writing_to_review_file_type`. Use one input type at a time.  

5. **File URLs and Types**:  
   - **Criteria File**: Use `criteria_file_url` and `criteria_file_type` to provide the evaluation criteria as a file (e.g., `pdf`, `docx`).  
   - **Writing to Review File**: Use `writing_to_review_file_url` and `writing_to_review_file_type` to provide the writing to be reviewed as a file (e.g., `pdf`, `gdoc`).

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Writing to Review as a File, Criteria as Text  
tool_data:  
tool_id: writing-feedback-generator  
grade_level: university  
assignment_description: Linear Algebra  
criteria: Understand the concepts of vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix operations.  
writing_to_review:  
criteria_file_url:  
criteria_file_type:  
writing_to_review_file_url: https://example.com/writing-to-review.pdf  
writing_to_review_file_type: pdf  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the writing to be reviewed is provided as a file, while the criteria are provided as text.

---

#### Example 2: Both Writing and Criteria as Files  
tool_data:  
tool_id: writing-feedback-generator  
grade_level: university  
assignment_description: Linear Algebra  
criteria:  
writing_to_review:  
criteria_file_url: https://example.com/criteria.pdf  
criteria_file_type: pdf  
writing_to_review_file_url: https://example.com/writing-to-review.docx  
writing_to_review_file_type: docx  
lang: en  

- **Here**, both the writing to review and the criteria are provided as files, so their respective text fields are left blank.

---

#### Example 3: Writing as Text, No Criteria  
tool_data:  
tool_id: writing-feedback-generator  
grade_level: university  
assignment_description: Linear Algebra  
criteria:  
writing_to_review: Linear regression is a statistical method to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables.  
criteria_file_url:  
criteria_file_type:  
writing_to_review_file_url:  
writing_to_review_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the writing to review is provided as text, and no criteria are included (both text and file fields for criteria are blank).

---

### Key Rules:

1. **Criteria**:  
   - Use **either** `criteria` (text) or `criteria_file_url` and `criteria_file_type` (file), but not both.  

2. **Writing to Review**:  
   - Use **either** `writing_to_review` (text) or `writing_to_review_file_url` and `writing_to_review_file_type` (file), but not both.  

3. **Mix-and-Match**:  
   - You can mix text and file inputs for criteria and writing to review.  

4. **File Types**:  
   - Ensure correct file types (e.g., `pdf`, `docx`, `gdoc`) are specified when using file inputs.  

5. **Language**:  
   - Default language is `en`. Specify if a different language is required.
