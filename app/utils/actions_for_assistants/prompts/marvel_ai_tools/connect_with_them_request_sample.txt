YOU MUST RESPECT THE VARIABLE NAMES

The input can handle either **text descriptions** for `task_description` and `students_description` or **file-based descriptions** using `task_description_file_url`/`task_description_file_type` for the task and `student_description_file_url`/`student_description_file_type` for the students. For each field:

- **Text Descriptions**: Use the `task_description` and `students_description` fields to provide descriptions directly as strings, leaving the file-related fields (`task_description_file_url`, `task_description_file_type`, `student_description_file_url`, `student_description_file_type`) empty.
- **File Descriptions**: Use `task_description_file_url` and `task_description_file_type` for the task description file and `student_description_file_url` and `student_description_file_type` for the students' description file, leaving the text fields empty.

### Example 1: Both Descriptions as Files  
tool_data:  
tool_id: connect-with-them  
grade_level: university
task_description:  
students_description:  
task_description_file_url: https://example.com/task-description.pdf  
task_description_file_type: pdf  
student_description_file_url: https://example.com/students-description.docx  
student_description_file_type: docx  
lang: en  

- **Here**, task and students' descriptions are provided as files, so text fields are left blank.

### Example 2: Both Descriptions as Text  
tool_data:  
tool_id: connect-with-them  
grade_level: university
task_description: Prepare a detailed report on linear regression applications.  
students_description: A group of university students specializing in statistics and data analysis.  
task_description_file_url:  
task_description_file_type:  
student_description_file_url:  
student_description_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the descriptions are provided as text strings, leaving file-related fields blank.

### Example 3: Mixed Input (Task as Text, Students as File)  
tool_data:  
tool_id: connect-with-them  
grade_level: university
task_description: Design a group project focused on predictive modeling.  
students_description:  
task_description_file_url:  
task_description_file_type:  
student_description_file_url: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkOTKlHnZC6Us2N-ZHgECsQezYoB49af/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107052763106493355624&rtpof=true&sd=true  
student_description_file_type: gdoc  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the task description is provided as text, while the students' description is a file.

### Key Rules:  
1. Use **only one type of input** (text or file) per description field.  
2. Ensure the file type (e.g., "pdf", "docx", "gdoc") is specified when using file-based inputs.  
3. Provide descriptions in a clear format, leveraging text or file inputs based on availability.
