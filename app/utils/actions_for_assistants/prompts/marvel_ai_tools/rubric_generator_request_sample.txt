YOU MUST RESPECT THE VARIABLE NAMES

### Input Guidelines:

1. **Grade Level**:  
   - Use the `grade_level` field to specify the level of education. Acceptable values include `pre-k`, `kindergarten`, `elementary`, `middle`, `high`, `university`, or `professional`.  

2. **Point Scale**:  
   - Provide an integer value in the `point_scale` field to define the rubric's scoring system.  

3. **Objectives**:  
   - Can be provided as a text string in `objectives` or as a file using `objectives_file_url` and `objectives_file_type`. Use one input type at a time.  
   - If using a file, ensure `objectives_file_type` matches the file format (e.g., `pdf`, `docx`).  

4. **Assignment Description**:  
   - Can be provided as a text string in `assignment_desc` or as a file using `assignment_description_file_url` and `assignment_description_file_type`. Use one input type at a time.  
   - If using a file, ensure `assignment_description_file_type` matches the file format (e.g., `gdoc`, `pdf`).  

5. **Language**:  
   - Specify the desired language in the `lang` field (e.g., `en` for English).

### Examples  

#### Example 1: Objectives and Assignment Description as Files  
tool_data:  
tool_id: rubric-generator  
grade_level: university  
point_scale: 4  
objectives:  
assignment_desc:  
objectives_file_url: https://example.com/objectives.pdf  
objectives_file_type: pdf  
assignment_description_file_url: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkOTKlHnZC6Us2N-ZHgECsQezYoB49af/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107052763106493355624&rtpof=true&sd=true  
assignment_description_file_type: gdoc  
lang: en  

- **Here**, both the objectives and assignment description are provided as files. Text fields for these inputs are left blank.

---

#### Example 2: Objectives and Assignment Description as Text  
tool_data:  
tool_id: rubric-generator  
grade_level: university  
point_scale: 4  
objectives: Students should be able to analyze data using linear regression techniques.  
assignment_desc: Write a detailed report on applying linear regression to predict outcomes in real-world scenarios.  
objectives_file_url:  
objectives_file_type:  
assignment_description_file_url:  
assignment_description_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, the objectives and assignment description are provided as text, leaving file-related fields blank.

---

#### Example 3: Mixed Input (Objectives as File, Assignment Description as Text)  
tool_data:  
tool_id: rubric-generator  
grade_level: university  
point_scale: 4  
objectives:  
assignment_desc: Create a presentation that demonstrates the steps for solving a linear regression problem.  
objectives_file_url: https://example.com/objectives.pdf  
objectives_file_type: pdf  
assignment_description_file_url:  
assignment_description_file_type:  
lang: en  

- **Here**, objectives are provided as a file, while the assignment description is provided as text.

---

### Key Rules:  

1. Use **only one input type** (text or file) for `objectives` and `assignment_desc`:  
   - Text: Fill the `objectives` or `assignment_desc` field.  
   - File: Fill the `objectives_file_url`/`objectives_file_type` or `assignment_description_file_url`/`assignment_description_file_type` fields.  

2. Always specify the correct file type (e.g., `pdf`, `gdoc`, `docx`) when using file inputs.  

3. Ensure that both text and file inputs for objectives and assignment descriptions are not used simultaneously.  

4. Other fields like `grade_level`, `point_scale`, and `lang` should always be provided for proper configuration.
