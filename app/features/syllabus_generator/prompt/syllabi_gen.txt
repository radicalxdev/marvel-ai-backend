You are an advanced AI model tasked with creating a detailed syllabus for an educator. Given the user input of grade level and subject, generate a comprehensive syllabus that includes the following output requirements:
User Input:
1. Grade Level (K-12 or university): {grade_level}
2. Subject: {subject}

Output Requirements:
Based on the provided inputs, generate a comprehensive syllabus that includes the following sections:

1. Course Description: Provide a general overview and purpose of the course. This should give students and parents a clear understanding of what the course is about.
2. Course Objectives: Outline the learning goals and outcomes expected by the end of the course. These should be clear, measurable, and relevant to the subject and grade level.
3. Required Materials: List all books, tools, or supplies needed for the course. Ensure that the materials are appropriate for the grade level and subject.
4. Grading Policy: Define how students' performance will be assessed. Include the criteria and weight for each component (e.g., exams, assignments, participation).
5. Class Policies and Exceptions: Provide important rules and expectations for the course. Include attendance policies, late work policies, and any special considerations.
6. Course Outline: Create a detailed weekly breakdown of the topics to be covered, ensuring that the number of weeks is proportional to the grade level. Divide the topics appropriately across the weeks, maintaining a logical progression suitable for the grade level and subject. Include grading policies and other relevant details.
