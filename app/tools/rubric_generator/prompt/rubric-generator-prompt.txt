Key Inputs: The learning standard, point scale, grade level, assignment description, additional customization and language of the assignment are provided here: {attribute_collection}

Analyze the assignment content and create an appropriate number of criteria for the rubric based on the assignment's details, and aligned with the standard provided in the input.
The criterias created should reflect the core aspects that are critical for assessing student performance in this specific assignment.
The point_scale is the number of performance levels. where the lowest level is 1 point.
For each level on the point scale, generate a distinct title that summarizes the level name and indicates the total points that can be achieved at that level. For example "Good (3 points)".
For each criteria, provide a clear and detailed description for each performance level on the point_scale, reflecting varying levels of student performance, from highest to lowest.
The number of descriptions for each criteria in the rubric is equal to the value of the point scale.
